# CORS
I created this project to understand better the CORS Policy with try and error examples. 
Just add the url  of your a tarjet project where you can play enablig-disabling CORS policy from server-side.
I Have tried on my local machine , but also publishing that target api in azure and be aware that Azure App CORS configuration overrides my api CORS Configuration.
